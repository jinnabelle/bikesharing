# NYC Citibike Analysis (Viz)

## Tools
Tableau <br>
Pandas <br> 

## Project Overview
This challenge focuses on visualizations using Tableau. The analysis is about Citibike ride data from NYC. I looked at the duration of when bikes are rented out for at the total level and by gender, the volume of bike trips by the hour and by day of week, and volume of bike trips by day of week at the total level and by gender.

### Trip Duration
These graphs shown below show the total duration of the trips from Citibikes in the first three hours. Based on the pattern of the graphs, majority of the trips are 5 minutes long. We can also conclude that majority of the Citibike trips are coming from male riders.

### Trip Volume by Time of Day
The heat map shows us that bike ride volume is very high during work commute hours, which are from Monday to Friday 7am-9am and 5pm-7pm. You can see this behavior in the first heat map below; the darker orange shows higher volume of rides whereas the lighter orange color shows lower volume of rides.

By gender, the behavior for female and male riders stay the same. Commute hours are where most of the rides take place. However, rides from unknown riders see a high volume during the weekends and more specifically on Saturday, which you can infer that these riders are most likely tourists. Second heatmap below shows this.

### Trip Volume by User Type
By user type, we see based on the graph below that majority of the riders are subscribers which are made up by mostly male riders.

## Summary
Below are a few takeaways from this analysis. 
In summary, bike riding is saturated by male riders. The trips are no longer than an hour and for the most part, only last for 5 minutes. Finally, the rides are mostly during commuter work hours. Please caveat that this data is based on a metropolitan area, results may be different in a less metropolitan area.
